# Databricks Platform Kit

**AI-powered Databricks platform engineering.** Provision workspaces, configure Unity Catalog, set up networking, manage groups and permissions — all through natural language with your coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, and more).

> Sibling to the [Databricks AI Dev Kit](https://github.com/databricks-solutions/ai-dev-kit): where that kit gives coding agents Databricks-specific skills for *building on* the platform, this kit focuses on *standing up* the platform itself — workspaces, Unity Catalog, identity, and networking across Azure, AWS, and GCP.

## What it does

Tell your agent what you need, and it handles the rest:

- **Workspace provisioning** — VNet/VPC injection, Secure Cluster Connectivity across Azure, AWS, GCP
- **Unity Catalog** — opinionated setup: self-managed metastore, per-env catalogs, external locations, medallion schemas, Lakehouse Federation
- **Identity & governance** — account-level SCIM groups, tiered RBAC, service principals for jobs
- **Workspace config** — SQL warehouses, cluster policies, secret scopes, IP access lists
- **Private networking** — private link (AWS), Private Endpoints (Azure), Private Service Connect (GCP), hub-spoke, NCC for serverless connectivity (when you need it)
- **Built-in verification** — a 3-path test (classic cluster + serverless SQL warehouse + serverless notebook job) designed to catch common configuration failures after a deploy (it does not guarantee correctness or fitness for any particular use)

The agent writes the Terraform and SDK calls from scratch based on your specific requirements — no rigid templates to fill in.

## Architecture

```

    SKILL.md + AZURE.md / AWS.md / GCP.md
  deployment-verification/           #   3-path verification (mandatory after deploy)
    SKILL.md                         #     Cloud-agnostic
```

The agent uses `az login` / `aws configure` / `gcloud auth login` + `terraform` via shell. No third-party Python packages, no MCP server — just skills (the installer is a single stdlib-only Python script).

## What this repo ships (and what it doesn't)

This kit is a thin layer. It's worth being precise about what it is, because that's also what the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) covers:

**Shipped by this repo (covered by the license):**
- The skill files (`.claude/skills/**`) — the instructions that drive the agent.
- One PreToolUse hook (`hooks/block-cred-reads.py`, wired via `hooks/hooks.json` for plugin installs) and three pre-flight scripts (`.claude/skills/platform-provisioning/scripts/precheck-*.sh`).

**Brought by the user (not shipped here, each under its own terms):**
- **A coding agent** — Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, OpenCode, or Kiro — that reads the skills and executes commands (their respective vendors).
- **Terraform** and the **AWS / Azure / gcloud / Databricks CLIs** — the tools that actually provision infrastructure (their respective vendors).
- The user's own cloud credentials, accounts, and the choice of how to run the agent (interactive vs. auto mode, etc.).

In other words: the kit is the skills and a little glue. It orchestrates tools the user installs and authenticates separately, using credentials the kit never sees. The license and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) scope Databricks' responsibility to this repo's own contents — not to the agent, the cloud tools, or how the user chooses to operate them.

## Quick start

Run the installer, pick your agent(s), and start provisioning. The installer copies the
skills into the layout your agent expects and writes its instruction file — works with
Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, OpenCode, and Kiro.

### Prerequisites

- **A coding agent** — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, OpenCode, or Kiro
- **Python 3** — for the installer (`python3` on PATH; already present with the Databricks/cloud CLIs)
- **Terraform** >= 1.9.0: `brew install terraform`
- **Cloud CLI**: `az login` (Azure), `aws configure` (AWS), or `gcloud auth login` (GCP) — depending on which cloud you'll deploy to
- **Databricks CLI** >= 0.296.0: `brew install databricks` (older versions can serve stale tokens and break auth debugging)
- **Databricks account ID** — from the accounts console for your cloud (`accounts.cloud.databricks.com` for AWS, `accounts.azuredatabricks.net` for Azure, `accounts.gcp.databricks.com` for GCP)

### Install

By default the installer sets up skills at the **project** level (in the current
directory) — a good fit, but you must run your agent from that directory. Pass `--global`
(or choose global in the interactive prompt) to install once for **all** your projects.

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks-solutions/ai-platform-kit/main/install.sh)
```

<details>
<summary>Advanced options</summary>

```bash
# Install for a specific agent, globally, without prompts
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks-solutions/ai-platform-kit/main/install.sh) --agent codex --scope global

# Multiple agents at once
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks-solutions/ai-platform-kit/main/install.sh) --agents claude,cursor,codex

# Every supported agent
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks-solutions/ai-platform-kit/main/install.sh) --agent all
```
</details>

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks-solutions/ai-platform-kit/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

<details>
<summary>Advanced options</summary>

```powershell
# Download the script first, then pass arguments
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks-solutions/ai-platform-kit/main/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
./install.ps1 --agent codex --scope global
./install.ps1 --agents claude,cursor,codex
```
</details>

**Next steps:** respond to the interactive prompts (which agent, and project vs. global),
then open the folder in your agent and tell it what you want — see [Usage](#usage) below.

### Supported agents

The skill content is identical for every agent; only the packaging differs.

| Agent | Where skills go | Instruction file written |
|-------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` | `.claude/settings.json` + cred-block hook |
| OpenAI Codex | `.agents/skills/` | `AGENTS.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` | `.cursor/rules/ai-platform-kit.mdc` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.agents/skills/` | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Gemini CLI | `.agents/skills/` | `GEMINI.md` |
| Windsurf | `.agents/skills/` | `.windsurf/rules/ai-platform-kit.md` |
| OpenCode | `.agents/skills/` | `AGENTS.md` |
| Kiro | `.kiro/skills/` | native (Agent Skills) |

> **Credential safety on non-Claude agents:** the Claude Code install ships a PreToolUse
> hook that blocks reads of credential/state files. Other agents have no equivalent hook —
> run them in a **gated approval/sandbox mode** so tool calls that touch those files require
> confirmation.

<summary>Already cloned the repo, or want to run the installer directly?</summary>

A root `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` are committed, so Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini,
Windsurf, and OpenCode work the moment you clone — no install step. For Claude Code, the
`.claude/skills/` are auto-discovered on clone as well.

You can also call the installer script directly, skipping the `curl` wrapper:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/databricks-solutions/ai-platform-kit.git
cd ai-platform-kit
python3 scripts/skills-sync.py --agent codex --scope project   # or --into <path>
```
</details>

## Usage

Just tell your agent what you want:

> "Set up 3 Databricks workspaces (dev/stg/prod) on Azure with Unity Catalog and proper groups"

The agent will:
1. Ask the right questions (cloud, region, environment strategy, naming, networking, compliance)
2. Check your auth and gather inputs in one batch
3. Write Terraform tailored to your request
4. Deploy end-to-end with real `terraform apply`
5. Run the 3-path verification against a UC table before declaring done

## Skills

| Skill | What it does | When it loads |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **workspace-advisor** | Decide the workspace architecture, compute model, and security tier (T0–T11) when it's not yet known | "which tier", "help me choose", "not sure what to deploy", "serverless or classic" |
| **platform-provisioning** | Create workspaces, deploy infrastructure | "create a workspace", "provision", "deploy" |
| **unity-catalog-setup** | Metastore, catalogs, schemas, grants, Lakehouse Federation | "Unity Catalog", "metastore", "catalog" |
| **identity-governance** | Groups, users, SPs, RBAC | "groups", "permissions", "service principal" |
| **workspace-config** | SQL warehouses, policies, secrets, tokens | "SQL warehouse", "cluster policy", "secret" |
| **private-networking** | Private link, hub-spoke, NCC, GCP PSC | "private link", "PSC", "hub-spoke", "NCC" |
| **deployment-verification** | 3-path verification (classic + sqlwh + notebook), mandatory after any deploy | Loaded whenever a workspace + UC has been freshly deployed or modified |

Each skill loads independently — the agent only reads what's relevant to your request. Cloud-specific files (`AZURE.md`, `AWS.md`, `GCP.md` and their numbered topic siblings) are loaded based on your target cloud to prevent cross-cloud confusion.

## Supported clouds
